# Work Won't Love You Back
## By Sarah Jaffe

* Up until 30~40 years ago, ruling class lived off wealth leaving the work to lower classes
* Now the ownership class also works, and fetishize long hours 
* Lionization of _why_ we are working has contributed to lack of questioning about why we are working so much
* Fordist Compromise - Workers give up a bunch of their time (8 hours x 5 days a week), and get acceptable pay and benefits
* Provided some worker stability from the Great Depression to the 1960s, an era often longed for today
* 1970s saw markets tightening, and capital responded by closing production in high wage countries and moving to low-wage ones
* Neoliberalism:
	* 1: State driven process of societal, political and economic restructuring responding to a crisis in post-war capitalism
	* 2: Ideology of generating market relations through social engineering
	* --- Shifted dynamic from freedom TO do something into freedom FROM interference

* High-paying jobs and reliable benefits have increasingly been replaced with "fulfillment"
* Demands that you love your work is another request upon labor -- an uncompensated one
* Expectation taht I love work, but work is incapable of loving me back feels an unsatisfying relationship
* Love is a thing that happens between _people_. It's reciprocal
* Class consistently evolves to meet the ever changing needs of capitalism
* Exploitation is the gap between the amount you are paid versus the amount of income your employer gains from that
* Housewife was a term that originally described a women who had a cash income and was also in charge of expected household duties, whereas homemaker was a term emerging around 1890 to describe a wan fully immersed in her adoption of idealized wife behavior 
* Evolution in what capitalism demands trickles down to shape what it demands the role of woman to be
* Labor began demanding a "family wage" intended to allow a man to provide for his nonworking wife and children
* Brought along laws limiting work hours of children and women, facilitating acceptance of their weakness 
* New Deal is when modern idea of family began to emerge, resulting from uneasy compromise between labor and capital
* Henry Ford had a dedicated Sociological Department where workers would be interrogated on the job and home visits would occur to ensure wife is fully living up to her domestic responsibilities in order to get benefits from family wage
* Work as women's liberation began to emerge, even as idea that women should find fulfillment in tending housework still persisted
