 # Nathan Fielder's The Rehearsal

- Exploration of the morality of reality TV? 
- People's genuine emotions being manufactured purely for our entertainment
- What is the function of fiction vs non-fiction
- Can you have meaningfully emotional responses to artifice?
- Commentary on how much of our lives we are performing roles for others?
- What's the role of agency in all this?? Everyone had the power to abandon his rules and leave at any time. The Christian lady did eventually. The guy fighting with his brother did. Why was it rare?
- Can you tell someone who to love or not? (Remy and Nathan / Daddy)
- Should children be acting?? We witnessed Remy's challenges because of the nature of the show, but this is absolutely not the only one who has experienced such a thing

Most TV feels like it tries to placate the viewers, but this one feels like it actively provokes us

Very few moments in television this year as uniquely tense as Kor failing to tell the Cheap Chick in the City when time allowed, and instead waiting until the food was ready

The entire setup feels like Nathan is conducting his own replicant test on himself
  
Viral in a way that I want to seek out and talk to everyone about it
