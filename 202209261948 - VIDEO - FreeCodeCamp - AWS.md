-   Evolution of Cloud Hosting
    

-   Dedicated Server
    

-   A physical machine dedicated to a single business
    
-   Very expensive, high maintenance
    

-   Virtual Private Server (VPS)
    

-   One physical machine dedicated to a single business
    
-   Machine is virtualized into sub-machines, allowing multiple sites
    
-   Better utilization and isolation of resources
    

-   Shared Hosting
    

-   One physical machine shared by hundreds of business
    
-   Relied on under-utilization by some parties
    
-   Very cheap, limited functionality, poor isolation
    

-   Cloud Hosting
    

-   Multiple machines acting as one system allowing thousands of businesses 
    
-   Scalable, cost-effective, high configurability, secure
    

-   Amazon Web Services
    

-   Collection of cloud services that can be used together under a single unified API for a variety of workload
    
-   CSP - Cloud Service Provider
    

-   What is a CPS?
    

-   Services
    

-   Company that provides multiple cloud services
    
-   Cloud services chained together to create cloud architectures
    
-   Accessible via a single unified API
    
-   Services utilized by metered billing based on usage
    
-   Rich monitoring build in
    
-   Infrastructure as a service (database, etc…)
    
-   Automation 
    

-   If a company does not meet most of these, it is referred to as a Cloud Platform like Twilio, HashiCorp
    

-   Landscape of CSPs
    

-   Tier 1 (Top Tier)
    

-   Early to market, strong synergies, well recognizing in industry
    
-   AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform
    

-   Tier 2 (Mid-Tier)
    

-   Backed by well-known companies, slow to innovate, turned to specialization
    
-   IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, Rackspace
    

-   Tier 3 (Light Tier)
    

-   Virtual Private Servers (VPS)
    
-   Simple, cost-effective
    
-   Vultr, Digital Ocean, Linode
    

-   Common Cloud Services
    

-   Often have hundreds of services, but Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) always have four core services
    

-   Compute
    

-   Virtual computer that can run code
    

-   Networking
    

-   Virtual network defining internet connections, isolations, outbound content management
    

-   Storage
    

-   Virtual hard drive 
    

-   Databases
    

-   Virtual database for storing and reporting data
    

-   AWS has 200+ services
    

-   Types of Cloud Computing
    

-   SaaS - Software as a Service
    

-   Run and managed by the service provider
    
-   It just works! Don’t worry about it!
    
-   Designed with customers in mind
    
-   Office 365, Gmail, salesfore
    

-   Paas - Platform as a Service
    

-   Focus on deployment and management of your apps
    
-   Don’t worry about configuring the hardware or OS
    
-   Heroku, Google App engine
    

-   IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service
    

-   Building blocks for cloud IT
    
-   Provides access to networking features, computers and storage space
    
-   Don’t worry about IT staff, data centers and hardware
    
-   AWS, Azure, Oracle Cloud
    

-   Cloud Computing Deployment Models
    

-   Public Cloud
    

-   Everything built on CSP
    
-   All the infrastructure is in within AWS, etc…
    
-   Cloud First or Cloud Native
    

-   Private Cloud
    

-   Everything built on company’s datacenters 
    
-   AKA “On-Premise”
    

-   Hybrid Cloud
-   Blend of on-premise and a CSP
-   Cross loud
