# People Overestimate Their Abilities
Topics: [[Self-Awareness]]

Students who were asked to estimate the amount of time it would take to complete their doctoral thesis, even baking into the assumption that everything that could go wrong would go wrong, _still_ overestimated their ability.

The average amount of time it took to complete the thesis was almost _double_ their estimated completion time.

Even when assuming the worst case scenario, people are still wildly too optimistic in their estimates about their ability to accomplish tasks in a certain time frame.
