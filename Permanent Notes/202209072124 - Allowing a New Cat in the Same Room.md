# Allowing a New Cat in the Same Room

When a new cat is brought into the same room as the resident cat, "Eat, Play, Love" is the most effective approach.

Do not leave them bored, and keep them focused on play with their favorite toys or favorite treats.

Letting them focus on the other cat will likely result in a staredown, which likely turns into a fight. 

Do your best to separate the cats when things are positive, and then try again the next day.
