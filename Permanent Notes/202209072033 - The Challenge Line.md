# The Challenge Line
**Topics:** [[Personal Growth]]


When introducing cats, it is a common strategy to place their bowls relatively close together on opposite sides of a closed door.

There is a distance at which two cats will be able to comfortable eat -- this is their comfort zone.

There is a distance closer than which they will not be able to eat -- this is the zone where they feel challenged.

The challenge line is the line separating these two zones where the cat's perception of the situation shifts from comfort to discomfort.
