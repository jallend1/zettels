# Major Questions Doctrine
**Topics:** [[202207112201 - Judicial Philosophy]]

As part of its duties, Congress delegates certain authority to executive agencies and grants them broad discretion. The conservative Supreme Court has been pushing back on that, contending that if the executive agency is drawing a big conclusion or making a major decision, it needs to clearly point to narrow statuory authority. 

This doctrine is not clearly defined and it's scope seems to be limited only to Joe Biden at this point.
