The Constitution isn't a very democratic document, but the process of making it one began almost immediately after its ratification. 

Universal white male suffrage existed essentially existed by Andrew Jackson's time, with Black men gaining it 40 years later, and women several decades after that. 

Coupled with an amendment that allow for the direct election of senators and the existence of the electoral college today primarily as a ceremonal organization, the logic of the Constitution has pointed towards increased democratization from the beginning.
