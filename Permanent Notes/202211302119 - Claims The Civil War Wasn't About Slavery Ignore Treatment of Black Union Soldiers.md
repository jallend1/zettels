# Claims The Civil War Wasn't About Slavery or Race Ignore Treatment of Black Union Soldiers

**Topics:** [[Civil War]], [[Retroactive Narratives]]

Those that claim The Civil War wasn't actually about slavery or that Confederate soldiers were good people simply defending their home fail to meaningfully grapple with the horrible treatment reserved exclusively for Black Union soldiers.
