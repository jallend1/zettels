If your goal is to have society led by moral, skilled and talented leaders, a rigged system that draws only from a specific pool for elevation is obviously undesirable. If there is only one party that you believe should be morally allowed to rule, why should creating an uneven playing field to make that happen be bad?

But if instead of talent or ability, your focus is instead on loyalty to a political party or a particular value, a rigged system that elevates people by dedication to that ideal is not an unreasonable proposition. It is not good for a well-functioning state, but if the goal is instead to reward loyalty, it is not an irrational choice (although I contend it is an immoral one)
