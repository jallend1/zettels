# The Four Desires Driving All Human Behavior

**Topics:** [[Human Nature]], [[202207162131 - Authoritarianism]]

1. Acquisitiveness - The desire for _stuff_, arising from some combination of fear of not having enough, and the desire for more. 
2. Rivalry - Dominating acquisitiveness, humanity will happily suffer if it means that they're rivals will be destroyed or suffer more.
3. Vanity - Upstaging even rivalry, the "look at me" desire is core to our existence from the very beginning of our consciousness
4. Love of Power - The most powerful of all, gaining it only makes one crave more of it. The greatest demonstration of it is in making people do things they would rather not do, as evidenced by many autocratic regimes.
