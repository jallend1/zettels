MP3.com made an early effort at being an online music service by letting users upload their own CDs, but made a critical mistake:

Instead of having users actually upload their own ripped copies of their CDs, they instead went out and bought tens of thousands of CDs and made unauthorized digital copies of them. It then let users play those centrally stored copies, instead of ones originating from the users.
