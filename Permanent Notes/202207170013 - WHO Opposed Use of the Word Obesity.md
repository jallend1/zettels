# WHO Opposed Use of the Word Obesity

In 1995, the World Health Organization panel decided that the word "obesity" should not be used on the spectrum of BMI numbers because the body mass index was not designed to measure fat content, a thing the word "obesity" directly suggests.

It reversed course two years later in large part from lobbying from a task force of weight loss drug marketers.
