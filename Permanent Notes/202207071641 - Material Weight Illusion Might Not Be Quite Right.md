# Material Weight Illusion Might Not Be Quite Right
**Related:** [[202207071637 - Material Weight Illusion]]

When people were presented with objects that looked to be comprised equally of two different materials (stone, styrofoam, and wood) but the same weight, subjects regularly chose the combination of materials that you would expect to be heavier -- in direct conflict with the material weight illusion.

This may be because our brain is contextualizing the information, and on the objects comprised of two different materials of equal weight, they were coming to the conclusion that the heavier material was indeed heavy, but not as heavy as they initially guessed.
