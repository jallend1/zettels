# Libraries Are Provided Exclusive Exemptions From Copyright Law

**Topics:**  [[202208261826 - Copyright ]]

17 US Code ยง 108 grants libraries and archives the ability to make a copy of a copyrighted item if:

1. The copying is not done for _either_ direct or indirect financial gain
2. The library or archives must be open to the public or to outside researches
3. The copy includes a copyright notice citing this section

There has been *very* little case law testing the boundaries of section 108!
