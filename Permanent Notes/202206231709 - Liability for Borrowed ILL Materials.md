# Liability for Borrowed ILL Materials
**Topics:**[[Responsibility]][[Rewarding Kindness]]

The borrowing library is financially responsible for an item from the moment it leaves the lending library until it is returned to them. 

The premise is that were it not for that loan, it would remain safe on the shelf, and the library should not be punished for its charitable effort.
