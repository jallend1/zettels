# Design Flaws Doomed Thomas the Tank Engine
**Topics:** [[Design]]

Thomas the Tank Engine is an LB&SC E2 that was initially designed for hauling freight, but designed with both water tanks and fuel capacity that weren't large enough for the role. Coupling the limited fuel capacity with the oscillation of the engine itself that caused an uncomfortable ride for riders, it also proved itself to be poorly suited to passenger travel. While it did find some limited utility unloading boats at the shipyards, it was severely limited in even that small role as it was relegated to only a portion of the shipyard where the tracks provided a turning radius the LB&SC E2 was capable of making. Thomas was a fundamentally flawed design from the beginning that never found a niche where it could thrive.
