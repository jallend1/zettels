**Topics:** [[202207052049 - Wordpress]]

mu-plugins is a developer created subfolder of wp-content that contains plugins that **must** be used. 

WordPress only loads the PHP files in the main directory, so each must-use plugin needs to have a file in the mu-plugins directory, though it can (and likely should) point to sub-folders.
