# Productive Relationship with Technology
**Topics:** [[Design]] [[Unintended Consquences]]

Rather than just accept a new technology into your life in the same way its creator wants you to use it, giving thoughtful consideration to what you hope to achieve from using it can define a healthy relationship with it. Their entire product is designed to keep your eyeballs on their site, when you almost certainly use it because you sense some utility. Focus your use on that utility, and avoid behaviors that don't facilitate that.

If you use Facebook to connect to family, is Facebook actually the best way to maintain those relationships? It seems unlikely it's ever the best way to maintain a relationship, but Facebook is designed explicitly to simulate those feelings of connection and keep you using it. 

If the goal of using Twitter is to be available for job opportunities or networking, make sure your use is targeted towards those activities. Social media seems like it could be a nice entry point, but only if it can be leveraged into something meaningful. The odds that happens doesn't seem particularly high, and it's important to consider the return on investment for the hours invested.
