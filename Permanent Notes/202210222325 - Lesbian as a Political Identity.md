Some second-wave feminists like the Daughters of BIlitis defined lesbian primarily as a political ideology defined by the desire to extricate themselves from physical and economical connections to men, and not defined by sexual attraction to other women. 

It was a movement dominated by college-educated youth, and didn't gain much traction among older lesbians who felt the abandonment of sexual preference as a defining characteristic was detrimental to the cause of gay rights.
