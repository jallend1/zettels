# John McCain's Eligibility for POTUS
**Topics:** [[Unintended Consquences]] [[Ambiguity]]

The Constitution limits eligibility for POTUS to only natural-born citizens.

John McCain was born in the Panama Control Zone to American citizens, and Congress passed a law in 1937 explicitly granting citizenship to children born in the Panama Canal Zone to American parents after 1904. 

John McCain was born in 1936, so he was not a citizen for the first year of his life, only retroactively gaining that status. 

The courts have never ruled on the definition of "natural-born citizen," so the legality of John McCain's run is bizarelly still a legitimate question.
