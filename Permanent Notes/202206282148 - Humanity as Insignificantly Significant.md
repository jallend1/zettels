First when we learned that the universe does not, in fact, revolve around the Earth. Then again when we learned about the Theory of Evolution and were forced to come to the conclusion that we are not the result of divine guidance.

While the history of science shows us how trivial much of our existence is, humanity has become a geological force for bad.
