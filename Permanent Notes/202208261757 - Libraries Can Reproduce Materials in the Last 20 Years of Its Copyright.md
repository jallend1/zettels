# Libraries Can Reproduce Materials in the Last 20 Years of Its Copyright

**Topics:** [[202208261826 - Copyright]]

Libraries are allowed to reproduce or digitize copyrighted materials that are in the last twenty years of their copyright period if they make a reasonable effort to find out:

1. The work is not subjec to to normal commercial exploitation, which is odd language, but likely just means in the marketplace
2. A copy cannot be acquired at a reasonable price
3. The copyright holder has not filed a notice with the Register of Copyrights that either of the first two apply, which has happened precisely zero times since this became law

Example: [Sonny Bono Memorial Collection](https://archive.org/details/last20)
