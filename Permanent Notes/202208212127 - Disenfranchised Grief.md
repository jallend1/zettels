# Disenfranchised Grief
**Topics:** [[202208212147 - Grief]]

Grief when there is a sense of illegitimacy around it that prevents it from being openly experienced out of fear of support from one's peers. Especially around the loss of a pet, where the loss of an animal comes with feelings that it should not be comparable to the loss of a human.
