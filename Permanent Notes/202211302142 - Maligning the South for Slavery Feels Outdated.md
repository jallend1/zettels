# Maligning the South for Slavery Feels Outdated

The South went to war to preserve slavery, but the focus and scorn on just that region for their racism feels a little arbitrary in the 21st Century. New York banned slavery in 1831, but up until that point had the largest slave market outside of Charleston, and even then still allowed slave catchers to walk their streets for decades. Even when the war started, the mayor of New York City proposed secession in order to preserve the city's financially lucrative relationship with the South. 

Does putting so much emphasis on the South's relationship with slavery and racism during the Civil War primarily serve the purpose of making "us" feel like the good guys? Even though 1) My state didn't exist during the Civil War and 2) States like New York only rejected slavery 30 years before the South? How much more morality is gained from ending slavery 190 years ago versus ending it only 160 years ago?
