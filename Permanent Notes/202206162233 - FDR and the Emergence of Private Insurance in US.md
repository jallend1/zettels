# FDR and Emergence of Private Insurance
**Topics:** [[202206212145 - Health Care Reform]][[202206162247 - Labor Unions]][[Unintended Consquences]]

Because FDR felt that the strong opposition to health care expansion would harm the passage of the rest of his New Deal legislation, he kind of steered clear of the issue of comprehensive health care reform.

BUT.

During World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt imposed limits on the ability of employers to raise wages in an effort to curb inflation. But he did not include the emerging concept of private health care plans in that ban. So while all these private manufacturers were limited to approximately the same wages, health care plans became a powerful incentive to lure skilled workers to your company.
