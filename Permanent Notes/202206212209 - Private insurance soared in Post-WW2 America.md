# Private Insurance Soared in Post-WW2 America
**Topics:** [[202206162233 - FDR and the Emergence of Private Insurance in US]]

Because of wage limitations imposed by FDR during World War II, private companies turned to health care benefits as a way to lure in workers. As a result, the number of Americans with private insurance soared from 9% just before World War II up to nearly 80% of non-elderly Americans.

The dominance of private insurance in the American healthcare system is the direct result of policies implemented by the federal government.
