Benjamin Franklin cannot by any stretch be said to have been empathetic to the plight of Black Americans, but he did have somewhat of an evolution when he visited the school his wife enrolled the child of a slave they owned.

He was taken aback to find that the students "are equal in every respect to that of white children." Though an admirable step, he then proceeded to say that he will not make an effort to justify his prejudices or to account for them.
