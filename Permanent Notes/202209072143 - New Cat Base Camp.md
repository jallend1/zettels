Set up a small portion of the house to allow a cat to get familiar with the new surroundings.

Because being in an entirely new environment will make everything challenging, ease the process by letting the new cat get comfortable in a smaller space before expanding out. 

Necessities:
1. Food
2. Water
3. Litter box
4. Scratching Post
5. Bedding
6. Toys
