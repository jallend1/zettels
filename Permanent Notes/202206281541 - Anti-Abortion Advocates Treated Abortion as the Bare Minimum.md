# Anti-Abortion Advocates Treated Abortion as the Bare Minimum
**Topics:** [[Responsibility]] [[Change]], [[202207112226 - Reproductive Rights]]

Anti-abortion advocates never waivered in their commitment to voting for candidates that support their views, but also recognized that voting is the absolute bare minimum.

Even though national Republicans never really advocated for national abortion bans and instead left it up to local governments to move the needle, abortion activists never stopped voting for those candidates.

While doing so, they coordinated with one another forming vast networks of actvists, filing lawsuits, and crafting the infrastructure to put judges they like on the bench.
