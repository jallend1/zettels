# Material Weight Illusion
**Topics:** [[Self-Awareness]]

If a person is presented with two items of precisely equal weight, but one is composed of something we traditionally perceive as heavy like stone and the other is comprised of something traditionally light like styrofoam, our brain will assess the styrofoam as the heavier of the two.

Our brain is trying to rectify our lived experience that has taught us that styrofoam is actually very light, and tell us that it is instead the case that this particular piece of styrofoam is uniquely heavy, even though it is the same weight as the stone.
