# The Merrick Garland Dilemma
Merrick Garland came into the role as Attorney General with a goal of depoliticizing the Department of Justice after the damage Trump and Barr did it.

But a key part of depoliticization is the equal application of the laws regardless of class or party, and the application of thoe laws to one of the nation's richest men and head of a national political party cannot help but be seen by many as partisan in nature.

Can you depoliticize a department by engaging in an act that will immediately and irrevocably bog you down in partisan entanglements?
