# Undead Constitutionalism
**Topics:** [[202207112201 - Judicial Philosophy]], [[Language]]

An Adam Serwer coined concept describing the phenomena of Republican justices adopting whatever fever is currently plaguing right wing media outlets, and framing their opinion as if to pretend that the Constitution has always been interpreted the current spicy take.

The prism conservative justices are looking through is not a legally principled one, but instead solely focused on filtering whatever popular Republican opinion. 

There are two Americas in this worldview -- the liberal one, and the real one. And the liberal one is inherently invalid.
