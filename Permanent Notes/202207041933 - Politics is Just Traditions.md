**Related:** [[202207162134 - Political Philosophy]]

We like to believe that politics is all codified into easily identifiable rules, but it's uncomfortably often simply the result of unwritten agreements.

The period between Election Day and Inauguration Day is a period filled with what had previously been embraced as largely ceremonial and procedural steps. 

But the Trump team made a concerted effort to challenge these procedural steps, treating each one as if it was a breakpoint. Doing so permanently alters the spectrum everyone is operating within, shifting what is possible in the future.
