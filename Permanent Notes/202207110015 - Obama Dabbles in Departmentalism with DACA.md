# Obama Dabbles in Departmentalism with DACA
**Topics:** [[202207102251 - Constitutional Departmentalism]]

When Barack Obama announced the DACA program, in that announcement he identified it as a stopgap measure because he determined that it was only within congressional authority to defer the rights of citizenship onto people.

It is logical and assumed that each branch makes determinations about what is and what is not within their constitutional authority. This is a thing they do regularly, so they already dabble in departmentalist views of the Constitution.
