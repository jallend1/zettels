# Myth of Black Confederate Soldiers

**Topics:** [[Retroactive Narratives]]

The idea that Black people fought (willingly) on behalf of the Confederacy was not a popular idea until the 1970s, coinciding with broader acceptance among Americans that the Civil War was a conflict over slavery and not some abstract disagreement about the structure of government. 

The Confederacy did repeatedly revisit the idea of using slaves in its armies, and constantly decided not to, in part, because arming Black Americans undercut their very premise for going to war. 

The South had the opportunity to put all of their resources into gaining independence. Instead, they sought to protect the institution of slavery.
