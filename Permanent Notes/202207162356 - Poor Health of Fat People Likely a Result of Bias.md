# Poor Health of Fat People Likely a Result of Bias
**Topics:** [[Bigotry]]

Overweight people are treated differently by society, and that bias is also evident in their treatment from the medical community. Overweight people are admitted to the hospital at later stages of a disease, provided medications later, and transferred to the ICU later. Additionally, overweight people are likely to seek out medical care later in the course of an illness than non-overweight people, likely a result of their prior experience with the medical community.
