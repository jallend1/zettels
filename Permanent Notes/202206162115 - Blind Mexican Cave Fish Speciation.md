# Speciation Based on Changing Language
**Topics:** [[Language]]

The Blind Mexican Cave Fish, a frequent occupant of my fish tank when life is going just right, is in the midst of speciation based on the evolution of their language. 

These little guys diverged from their sighted cousins as little as 20,000 years ago, and sought refuge in the darkness of caves. Gradually their ability to see faded out of their genes, and the little buddies developed a clicking communication system. 

But this study suggests the clicks are diverging between the cave fish at different locations. While they currently have no difficulty understanding occupants of other caves, the fact that they are developing different clicking systems could make it harder for them connect in the future.
