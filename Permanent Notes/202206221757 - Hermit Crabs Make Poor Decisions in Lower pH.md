# Hermit Crabs Make Poor Decisions in Lower pH

Hermit crabs change their shells as they grow and their existing ones fall into disrepair. When the crabs make the change, they explore the potential new residence through chemical, visual and tactile analysis. But when the crabs were exposed to water with a lower pH level, which is also a consequence of ocean acidification, the ability of the hermit crabs to accurately assess the quality of shells significantly declined. Some did not make the move into the better shells, but even the ones that did, did so at a substantially slower pace. Environmental conditions had a dramatic impact on the ability of hermit crabs to make meaningful decisions.
