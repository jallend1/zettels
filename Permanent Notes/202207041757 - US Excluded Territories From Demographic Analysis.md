# US Excluded Territories From Demographic Analysis

Because off-mainland territories were excluded from key datasets, America crafted a particular image of itself that did not reflect reality as much as it reinforced their own perceptions of themselves.

While Census data was collected in offshore territories, the subsequent datasets that provided breakdowns of key demographics of Americans included only the mainland itself. This created a perception of America where it's largest minority was Black people, but in actuality Asians were the largest minority. 

Exclusion of certain information resulted in America reaffirming a perception of itself that was disconected from reality -- a perception that certainly flavored policy priorities.
