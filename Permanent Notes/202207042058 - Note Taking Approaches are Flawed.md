# Note Taking Approaches are Flawed
**Related:** [[202207042012 - Fleeting Notes]]

Jotting down notes in an outline or highlighting them in a book make immediate sense in that it identifies a piece of important information.

It's an easy task to accomplish in the moment, but identifying information that's important is not the goal -- the goal is to learn. Having disparate notes using a wide array of methods and in different storage locations fundamentally undermines the goal of notes. This is essentially treating all note taking as if they are equivalent to the Fleeting Notes of the Zettelkasten system.
