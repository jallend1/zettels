# Autoloaders
A function that will load all classes that appear in your file automatically.

Example:

```php
spl_autoload_register ( function ( $class ) {
	include 'includes/' . $class .'php';
});

new Student();
```

In the above code, when the file is run, it is scanned for class declarations. It then runs all those classes through the function that includes the corresponding PHP file.
