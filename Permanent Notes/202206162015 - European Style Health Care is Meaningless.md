The phrase "European style health care" is frequently tossed around by Republicans as a scare strategy, and Democrats as an aspirational goal for America's own health care system. 

But the health care situations are wildly different across Europe:

- In Sweden, health care is provided exclusively by the government
- In France, health care is a blend of government and private insurance
- In Netherlands, health care is provided exclusively through private insurance

"European style health care" is an phrase devoid of any actual meaning. It means better than American health care or worse than American health care dependent upon who is saying it, and absolutely nothing more.
