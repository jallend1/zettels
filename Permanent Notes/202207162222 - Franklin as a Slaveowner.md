# Franklin as a Slaveowner

**Related:** [[202207162214 - Franklin's Racism]]

While Franklin did oppose importing slaves, it was not on moral grounds, but only on the grounds that it creates "enfeebled" white slave owners.

Franklin did own slaves, and while he evolved to oppose slavery and frequently ran anti-slavery pieces in his newspapers, he never freed any of his slaves, with their only exit being escape or death.
