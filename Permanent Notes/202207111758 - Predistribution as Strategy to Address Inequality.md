# Predistribution as Strategy to Address Inequality
Instead of relying on redestribution of wealth through taxation and social programs, shifting the focus on a predistributive approach would increase efficiency and also decrease the inherent resistance people have to giving government their money through taxes.

This can be accomplished through increasing the strength of unions, or other tools like dedicating 10% of corporate shares into a fund that pays dividends to employees.
