In the year of our Lord 2022, Roosevelt's effort at expanding the size of the Supreme Court because of its overt antagonism towards his New Deal agenda during a time of calamitous suffering in the country is almost unequivocally referred to as a "scheme." It was an unpopular act at the time, but also part of a much broader effort to highlight how the court operates and its undemocratic nature.

Although his party pushed back on him and it never came to pass, the Supreme Court didn't fundamentally soften its criticisms and adopted a much friendlier attitude toward his policies. Ensuring that his New Deal agenda wasn't overturned by the Supreme Court was the purpose of his threat to expand the Court, so why in God's name is it being treated as a gross overreach and a cautionary tale?
