Internet Archive is being sued by book publishers for its controlled digital lending program, and IA is contending that the one of the real problems for book publishers is that the CDL program is decreasing friction too much.

Book publishers want it to be somewhat challenging for patrons to acquire materials because if it is, they will give up and buy their own copy. 

The Copyright Act doesn't protect rightsholders from "friction" or protect the right to make materials hard to acquire.
