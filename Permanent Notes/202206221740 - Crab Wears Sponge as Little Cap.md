# Crab Wears Sponge as a Little Cap  

The Lamarckdromia beagle, a "fluffy" crab adorns itself with a sponge on its head as a natural defense against predators since sponges emit a lot of chemicals many predators find unpleasant. It's similar in purpose to the hermit crab acquisition of shells for defense, but cutting up a sponge and affixing it to your body is infinitely more boss. They even trim the sponge to snugly fit against its head, like a neat little cap which they hold in place with unique little hat holding claws.
