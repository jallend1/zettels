# Permanent Notes

These notes should be drawn from both the [[202207042012 - Fleeting Notes]] and the [[202207042026 - Literature Notes]] regularly before you have the opportunity to forget the context of the original notes.

These should be made of full sentences and limiting yourself to one idea per note. Connect these cards to other related notes. Creating an index of related cards creates an easy entry point into the Zettelkasten.
