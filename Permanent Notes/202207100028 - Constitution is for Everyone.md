# Constitution is a Layman's Document
**Topics:** [[202207112201 - Judicial Philosophy]]

In 1937, FDR made a speech to the American people declaring that "The Constitution of the United States was a layman's document, not a lawyer's contract. That cannot be stressed enough."

James Madison, the primary writer of the Constitution, was not a lawyer. Our first President was not a lawyer.  Franklin who kept the Constitutional Convention together was not. This is a document of the people and for the people, and should not be treated as beyond the comprehension of most Americans.
