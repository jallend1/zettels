The Constitution, a document that :

- Was ratified by slave-holding states
- Enshrined in its text another decade of the slave trade
- Codified the idea that non-whites are worth less
- Did not include women in its protections

is not a document that historically has been much concerned with freedom or equality. But treating it as if it were concerned with these things has been an integral part of the American myth about itself.

And that lie was so powerful, that it actually led to it becoming the case when movements like Women's Suffrage, Civil Rights, and gay rights all advocated for themselves by appealing to that myth that these adjustments would help the Constitution fill its "promise" of equality and equity. 

These movements all made America a better place because America lied to itself, and these movements were able to capitalize on that lie. They moved us in a direction that brought us to being closer to the version of ourselves that only exists in a lie.

Is the tension between lying about ourselves, and making ourselves better because of those lies uniquely American?
