The terms democracy and republic were tossed around interchangeably by the founders and their contemporaries, with the biggest distinction coming when they were referring to Greek or Roman principles. 

People in modern times seem to primarily bring up the "America is a republic not a democracy" as a piece of their argument that some ideas (Republican ones) should be elevated over others (Democratic ones).
