# Odd Scope of Gun Rights in Heller
**Topics:** [[Constitutional Originalism]], [[Gun Rights]]

The Heller Case justified itself by appealing to the original intent of the Founders in crafting the 2nd Amendment by treating it as an effort to keep tyranny at bay.

But the justices only found the right to bear arms for only handguns, which is not the type of weaponry would would actually require to keep tyranny at bay. The embrace of originalism goes only as far as is required to justify the conservative cause of the day.
