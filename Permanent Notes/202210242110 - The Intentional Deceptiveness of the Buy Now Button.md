Much like our relationship with software since the 1990s, we don't actually own any of the digital media we purchase. Instead, the companies are relying on the fact that we are almost certainly not going to read a 4-page licensing agreement for every $0.99 song purchase.

The companies could simply change their buttons to something like 'Lease Now' or 'Rent Now,' but they are intentionally taking advantage of making users feel like they own these digital items the same way they own physical copies of CDs or DVDs. 

This is a deception we only tolerate for digital media, and the FTC would step in to stop such overtly fraudulent practices for anything else.
