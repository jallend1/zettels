# Google Permanently Suspends Innocent Dad

**Topics:** [[Unintended Consquences]]

Google's AI, a service they share with Facebook, flagged a Dad's account after he sent the pictures a doctor requested of his son through his Gmail account. They deactivated and permanently deleted the account, even though police investigations found no evidence of abuse and refused to alter course on appeal. 

All his eggs were in a single tech company's basket, and he was completley denied access to that basket.
