# Ben Franklin Disseminated Abortion Recipe to Colonies
**Topics:** [[202207112226 - Reproductive Rights]]

In 1748, Benjamin Franklin adapted a popular life manual from Britain called "The Instructor" to be more relevant to life in the colonies. In so doing, he explicitly added a section into the manual that detailed the recipe for abortion.

Such an inclusion by one of the most famous Founding Fathers seems to fly in the face of Alito's assertion in the Dobbs opinion that abortion is "not deeply rooted in the Nation's history and traditions."
