# Feminism of Aaron Burr
**Topics:** [[Feminism]]

Aaron Burr introduced legislation into the New York State Assembly while holding a position there that would have expanded to women both the right to vote and the right to hold office.

He also argued that marriage was a relationship based on true friendship between equals, where the man's opinion was no more important than the woman's. 

Additionally, he was also a fierce advocate for the education of women.  Being frustrated by the options available to his daughter, he lamented that "You may as well just die as such a petty existence is just meaningless."
