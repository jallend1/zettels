# Franklin Invented Lightning Rods

**Related:** [[202207162158 - Franklin's Kite and Key Experiment]]

Ben Franklin developed the first lightning rods as a follow-up to the knowledge he gained from his kite and key experiment. He even was involved in installing them on St. Paul's Cathedral in London.

He refused to patent the technology because he thought good ideas belong to all mankind, but did receive pushback from religious leaders because they thought he was limiting one of God's tools for punishing the wicked.

Immanuel Kant dubbed him the "The Modern Prometheus" because of his ability to harness electricity.
