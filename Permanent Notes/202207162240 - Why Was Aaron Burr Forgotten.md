# Why Was Aaron Burr Forgotten

1. Aaron Burr was ganged up on by his contemporary political opponents, and many of those writings were preserved creating a lopsided historical record
2. He was preceded in death by both his wife and his daughter, so he didn't have anyone to advocate for his legacy in the same way that someone like Alexander Hamilton did.
3. Because most of his papers were lost at sea and the rest sold, shoddy research resulted in a simplified and villainous version of Burr being codified into history frequently serving as little more than a foil to our heroes.
