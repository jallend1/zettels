# PETA and The Boys Find Common Ground
**Topics:** [[Rewarding Kindness]]

Chace Crawfrod's character in "The Boys," The Deep, was forced to eat a live octopus by The Homelander in a season three episode of the Amazon Prime series. While not traditionally the type of activity you would expect PETA to celebrate, they were actually very enthusiastic about it.

First, the series used CGI for the eating scenes, with the show runner saying that the octopus "didn't deserve the cruel fate of being eaten raw." This kind of empathy to animals directly taps into what PETA wants more to people to recognize in their relationship with them.

Second, the octopus wasn't just portrayed as a random creature, but instead as a named individual (Timothy), with a family and an inner world all its own. 

While it does seem silly and an obvious grasp for attention by PETA, it does strike me as an effective way to glob onto things currently in the zeitgest. Especially so because it does tap directly into the entire point of that scene, as The Deep was tormented by the actions he was forced to take.
