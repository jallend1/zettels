# The Dreyfuss Affair
**Topics:** [[Bigotry]][[Political Polarization]]

Alfred Dreyfuss was convicted of treason for smuggling French secrets to the German embassy. He insisted on his innocence, and an investigation two years later revealed that the actual source of the leak was a French army major. 

Instead of exonerating him, the evidence was suppressed and additional charges were filed against Dreyfuss based on fabricated evidence. He eventually got a retrial, in which he was once again found guilty, but was pardoned and released.

Many were eager to accept that a Jewish man who spoke with a German accent (not a TRUE Frenchman) was at fault, and many right wing media and politicians were eager to fan the flames of bigotry to advance their agenda.
