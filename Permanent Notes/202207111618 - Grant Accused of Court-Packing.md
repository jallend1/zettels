Congress expanded the Supreme Court to 9 seats starting in 1870, giving Ulysses S. Grant 2 additional appointments. His two picks both reversed a controversial decision the previous court had rendered finding the greenback to be unconstitutional. 

Because his two appointments swiftly reversed that decision, a goal Grant sought, opponents accused him of packing the court.
