# Unions Sink Nixon's Health Care Overture
**Topics:** [[202206162247 - Labor Unions]][[202206212145 - Health Care Reform]]

Richard Nixon sought to address two fundamental problems with American health care:

1. Insurance being tied to employment, leaving people who are moving jobs or unemployed uninsured
2. Low deductibles at the time meant that simple things like routine visits were affordable, but unexpected and high cost emergencies were not

As Watergate was heating up, he sought to negotiate with Ted Kennedy and the Labor Unions, but amid his plummeting approval ratings, both were convinced that they would get a better deal after impeachment.

No deal came after impeachment.
