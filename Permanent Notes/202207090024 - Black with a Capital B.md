# Black with a Capital B
**Topics:** [[Language]]

America forged a new ethnic identity among slaves and their descendants by intentionally stripping them of any connection they may have had to their ethnic or national group when they were stolen. 

And we capitalize other ethnic identities like Asian, Hispanic, Native American, African-American and Indigenous, so it logically follows that Black would be capitalized, as well.
