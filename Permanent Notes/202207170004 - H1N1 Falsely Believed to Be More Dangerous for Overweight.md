# H1N1 Falsely Believed to Be More Dangerous for the Overweight

Initially H1N1 infections were thought to be believed more fatal to people overweight.

But after the outbreak had passed, it was discovered that people who were overweight did not get prescribed anti-virals at the same rate as non-overweight people.

Being prescribed these anti-virals later or not at all meant that the virus was able to rage in the body longer, and was not a result of any physiological distinction. 

Covid-19 was similarly thought to be more fatal for overweight people, but likely the result of the same biases.
