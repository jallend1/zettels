# Many Democratic Men Think Feminism is Harmful
**Topics:** [[Feminism]]

Unsurprising that Republican men (62% of those below 50 years old and 42% of those above) think that feminism has done more harm than good.

But what I do find surprising is that 46% of Democratic men under 50 agree with that statement, compared to just 4% of Democratic men over 50.
