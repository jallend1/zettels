When researchers asked respondents to determine the who they thought was most competent after showing them a picture of a congressional candidate and their runner-up from the 2000, 2002 and 2004 elections, respondents predicted the outcome of Senate races 71% of the time and House races 68.8% of the time, even though they had no prior knowledge of any of these candidates.
