# Chimps Copy Their Stylish Friends
**Topics:** [[Fashion, Delightful]]

A chimpanzee took a stiff piece of grass and put it in its ear, adjusting it so it would remain, and went about its normal chimpanzee business. Over the course of the next year, this behavior was repeated by 8 of the 12 other chimpanzees in this tribe. The neighboring chimpanzee groups didn't engage in this behavior, strongly suggesting that it had no environmental impetus. Instead, it seems analogous to a fashion fad the other chimpanzees were enthusiastic about.
