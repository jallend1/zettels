# Jefferson Advocates Departmentalism to Abigail Adams
**Topics:** [[202207102251 - Constitutional Departmentalism]]

After Thomas Jefferson pardoned people convicted under the Sedition Acts for the nasty words they wrote about President Adams, Abigail Adams wrote him expressing her discontent.

But Jefferson responded that it was within the authority of the Courts to interpret the Constitution within their scope, and they did so by sentencing them.

It is also true that Jefferson's role was to interpret the Constitution within the scope of the executive branch. He did so by determining that the law was unconstitutional, leaving him no choice but to excercise the authority granted to him and pardoned them.
