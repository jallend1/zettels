**Topics:** [[Censorship]], [[202207112226 - Reproductive Rights]]

Up until June of 2022, it was illegal for doctors and hospitals in Germany to promote and communicate about abortion services they offered to prospective patients. 

Violations of this agreement were punishable by up to two years in prison or fines. In 2019, a doctor was fined 6,000 Euros (later reduced to 2,500 Euros) for publishing this information on her website.

This was explicitly allowed by the ban lift June of 2022.
