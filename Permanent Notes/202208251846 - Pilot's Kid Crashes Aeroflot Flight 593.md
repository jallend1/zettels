# Pilot's Kid Crashes Aeroflot Flight 593

A Russian pilot let his two children come into the cockpit on their first international flight from Moscow to Hong Kong. The pilot adjusted the auto-pilot while his daughter sat in the pilot's seat to simulate that she was turning the plane.

When his 16-year-old son had his turn, his son used enough force to partially disengage the autopilot, but the pilots didn't notice.

The co-pilot was able to recover, but over-corrected and stalled the plane. All 78 people aboard died.

Later analysis revealed that if the pilots simply did nothing, the situation would have resolved itself.
