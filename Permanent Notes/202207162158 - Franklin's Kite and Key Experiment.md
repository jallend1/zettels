# Franklin's Kite and Key Experiment

**Related:** [[202207162203 - Franklin Invented Lightning Rods]]

Ben Franklin saw a similarity between lightning and the results of his own experiments with the emerging science of electricity.

He devised his famous kite and key experiment as a way to confirm that there was indeed electricity in the atmosphere during lightning storms.

Contrary to popular myth, his goal was not to get struck by lightning, but only to have the key show evidence that it is conducting electricity.

Europe was stunned that such a discovery would come from the provincial United States
