# Fear and Reward Motivators
**Topics:** [[Self-Awareness]]

People are motivated to do things for a wide variety of reasons, and while fear generally has negative connotations, it is a real and present force in our lives. Accomplishing a task because it yields positive rewards like financial compensation is no less meaningful than accomplishing a task out of fear that you will feel shame or your job will be in jeopardy. 

Motivating forces come in many varieties, it's only about harnessing those forces in healthy and low-stress ways.
