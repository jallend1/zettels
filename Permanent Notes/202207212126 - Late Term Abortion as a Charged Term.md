**Topics:** [[202207112226 - Reproductive Rights, [[Language]]]]

Many doctors and scientists avoid using the term "late-term" abortion because to those outside of the medical community, it evokes the inaccurate perception that it is occuring much closer to a full-term pregnancy than it actually is. 

Pregnancies last 40 weeks, and "late-term" abortions are generally accepted between the 21st and 24th weeks.
