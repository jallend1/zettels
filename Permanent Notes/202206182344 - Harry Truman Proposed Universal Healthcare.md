# Harry Truman Proposed Universal Health Insurance in 1945
**Topics** [[202206212145 - Health Care Reform]]

Just months into after Truman ascended to the presidency after FDR's death, he announced a five-pronged plan to improve the health of Americans and making health care accessible to all by charging workers a monthly amount in anticipation of times when serious illness would keep them from working.

The plan failed because the emerging Cold War dynamic heightened America's anxieties and suspicions about anything with a hint of socialism, a fact that the American Medical Association relied heavily upon in its campaign to decry the Truman administration as "followers of the Moscow Party line."

That campaign dove-tailed neatly with the worries of Southern Democrats who were concerned that such a national approach would lead to the racial integration of hospitals.

Initial enthusiasm for the plan waned and eventually collapsed under the concerted campaign against it.
