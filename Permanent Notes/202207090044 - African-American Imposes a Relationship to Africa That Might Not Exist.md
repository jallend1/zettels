# African-American Imposes a Relationship to Africa That Might Not Exist

The phrase African-American suggests a person has a relationship with the continent that there is no reason to assume even exists. 

There is the obvious foolishness of calling a Black British immigrant African-American. But even for Americans descended from slaves, they are imposed with a connection to a continent they may have zero connection to or affinity for based only on their skin color.
