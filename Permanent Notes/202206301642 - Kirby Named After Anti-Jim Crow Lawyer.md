# Kirby Named After Anti-Jim Crow Lawyer
**Topics:** [[Unintended Consquences]]

The Nintendo character of Kirby was named after John Joseph Kirby, a figure active in laying the groundwork for civil rights and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Much of his early life was dedicated to Department of Justice projects like identifying regions of the South where voter registration was lower than expected, discovering things like requirements that any voter be able to translate complex portions of the state constitution. He left public life after the "police riot" at the DNC Convention in 1968, only engaging meaningfully once more by participating on the commission investigating the Kent State killing. 

While those are his noble tasks, the honor was bestowed upon him after he won the copyright lawsuit when Universal sued Nintendo claiming that Donkey Kong was a violation of their rights to King Kong. In addition to that honor, he also won the naming rights to "Donkey Kong" in perpetuity, but only in regards to naming sailing boats.
