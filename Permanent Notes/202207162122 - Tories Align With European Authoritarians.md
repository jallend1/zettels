# Tories Align With European Authoritarians
**Related:** [[202207161911 - Common Cause of Far Right Parties]]

Tory Members of the European Parliament defended the far right Polish government's court-packing effort, one entirely anti-thetical to democracy, because they were part of the same caucus in the European parliament. 

Likewise, they protected Orban's efforts to punish Hungary's judiciary from censure by the European Union because they prioritized sovereignty over democratic values.
