# Independent Legislature Theory
**Topics:** [[202207162134 - Political Philosophy]]

An emerging conservative theory, with its roots in Rehnquist's opinion in Bush v. Gore, that argues that state legislatures are the ultimate source of electoral decisions within their respective states.

This would grant state legislatures the authority the gerrymander states at will, engage in legal voter suppression, or even entirely overturn election results. Some variations of this theory would also forbid legislatures from delegating their sovereignty over elections to governors or secretaries of states. This will also eliminate the ability of state supreme courts to intervene when the legislature is violating its rules as, essentially, there are simply no rules.
