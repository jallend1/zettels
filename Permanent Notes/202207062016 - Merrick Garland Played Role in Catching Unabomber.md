# Merrick Garland Played a Role in Catching Unabomber 
Merrick Garland served on the Unabomber task force and played a role in getting both the Washington Post and the New York Times to publish his manifesto.

His critics argue that he didn't do much to catch the Unabomber because he was only caught because his brother and sister-in-law recognized his writing style in his manifesto and reached out to authorities.
