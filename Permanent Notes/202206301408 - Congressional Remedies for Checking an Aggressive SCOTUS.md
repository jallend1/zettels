# Congressional Remedies for Checking an Aggressive SCOTUS
**Topics:** [[202207112150 - Supreme Court Reform]]

Potential remedies for checking an increasingly rogue Supreme Court, ranked from most to least favorite:
1. Imposing Term Limits
	* While the Constitution declares that judges receive lifetime appointments, it is obviously not true that it is only on the Supreme Court
2. Require a super-majority to overturn a law
	* 5-4 disagreements among the justices should not overturn the will of Congress
3. Strip the court of jurisdiction over certain issues
	* The Constitution directly delegates to Congress the authority to limit the scope of what appeals the court can hear
4. Pass Legislation that cancels out the decision
	* If SCOTUS invalidates a case based on a statutory reading, adjust the statute.
5. Change the Court Size
	* Feels an incomplete solution likely to receive a similar response from Republicans when they take office, but if things get real wild, just jack up the numbers. Feels like a definite Band-Aid that would only be useful for the short term.
