# Noble Obstacles
**Topics:** [[Self-Awareness]]

A noble obstacle is a task that we should actually take care of, but one we use at selective times to escape another task we want to avoid. If I have a paper I need to turn in tomorrow, hiding behind the nobility of a task like washing the dishes (something good in and of itself) is not about actually eliminating that task but only avoiding a more pressing one.
