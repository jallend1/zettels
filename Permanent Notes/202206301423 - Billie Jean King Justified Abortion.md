Billie Jean King got an abortion before the Roe v. Wade decision came down and in order to do so:

- Needed to present her case to a panel of dozen medical experts explaining why the abortion should be performed
- Required her husband's signature approval.

According to her auto-biography, the presentation to the panel was one of the most horrific experiences of her life.
