# PHP Traits
Traits allow you to extend only particular methods of one class onto another class instead of relying on a relationship of complete inheritance which might lead to a drilling down of inheritance that would otherwise be unnecessary. 

```PHP
trait Say_World{
	public function say_hello(){
		echo "Hello from trait!"
	}
}

class Base {
	use Say_World;
}

$base = new Base();
$base->say_hello();

```

Traits CANNOT be instantiated into their own entity and must be a part of a class.
