# Namespaces

The use of namespaces in PHP is a way to group a number of related items together, and to also easily avoid naming collisions.

The traditional way without namespaces:

```php
class Product{};
$product = new Product{};
```

Namespace must be the first code after the opening tag and inline comments of the PHP file:

```php
namespace App;
class Product{};
$product = new App\Product;
```
