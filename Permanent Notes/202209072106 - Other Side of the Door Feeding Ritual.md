# Other Side of the Door Feeding Ritual

To introduce a new cat, place feeding bowls three-feet away on opposite sides of a closed door. If there is any growling or hissing, the distance is inside the [[202209072033 - The Challenge Line]] and needs to be moved back. If there is no aggression, the distance between the bowls should be gradually decreased with each feeding.

Any time they smell food, they should be smelling each other, and anytime they smell each other, they should smell food. This fosters positive associations with the other cat and lowers hostility.
