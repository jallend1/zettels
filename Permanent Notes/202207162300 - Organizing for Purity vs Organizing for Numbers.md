# Organizing For Purity vs. Organizing for Numbers

I'm skeptical of [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2022/06/13/progressive-organizing-infighting-callout-culture) in general, but I am increasingly curious about the trade-off inherent in organizing for purity versus organizing for numbers. If you're organizing a BLM action, but refuse to work with someone who may be pro-life, you are hurting the BLM action by decreasing participants, and also not advancing the pro-choice movement by isolating people you may have common ground with on which to initiate positive conversations.

Is this moral purity also an issue on the right, or does the right rely more on converts, while the left is happy to make heretics of people who deviate? Has the left abandoned persuasion and instead only embraced contempt?
