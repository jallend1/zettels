# Vocational Awe and Librarianship

- Vocational awe - the idea that everything involved with libraries and their jobs are sacred, and directly contribute to issues like lower salary and burnout 
- Libraries are frequently referred to and treated as sacred spaces, and even were in their beginnings in monasteries and churches
	- Often seen as sanctuaries and safe-spaces, providing comfort to the disadvantaged
- Since libraries are sacred, it follows that those within its walls are also noble
	- Nobility also goes hand in hand with the concept of self-sacrifice
- PART TWO - LOCATING THE LIBRARY  IN INSTITUTIONAL OPPRESSION


Vocational awe as a hurdle towards white collar unionizing where they don't they think are "workers" in a traditional sense

Sees working adopting more and more responsibility because we CHOSE this life and owe it to the community
