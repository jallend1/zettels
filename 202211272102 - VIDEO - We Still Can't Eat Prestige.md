- Eagerness of library workers to work in challenging conditions and low pay exploited by management 
- Is the eagerness to work in challenging conditions limited to workers and not management? 
- Management is as eager to exploit workers altruistic desires in order to keep their own costs low
- Prestige is not a benefit offered by management 
- "Family" usually comes up from management when they are asking for sacrifices
- Way to short-circuit the merits of the request and appeal to emotion
