- Historians have preferred nation builders like Washington, who have a vast archive of published works
- Burr has been left primarily in the hands of non historians 
- Burr didn't act to secure his place in history by cataloging his records like other founders did
- Preceded in death by his wife and child, so no one to advocate
- Most of his papers were lost and others sold
- We have only one side of the story, and that one is from a prolific writer with vested interest in denigrating Burr
- Hamilton repeatedly emphasized that he would not be throwing his shot, despite claims by apologists
- Why 
	1. Ganged up on by contemporary political opponents for political gain
	2. Lack of posterity to defend and advocate for him
	3. Shoddy research has resulted in over simplified version. Became a foul for our heroes to fight against
- Grandson of Jonathan Edwards
- "I look on the child as one given to me from the dead" - Burrs Mom after he survived illness at 8 months
- Within a year, he lost both parents and grandparents
- While Hamilton and Lafayette were similarly youthful, they were both protected by Washington
	- Burr lacked the protection of a powerful general, since his had recently been forced out
- A guilty conscious needs no accuser
