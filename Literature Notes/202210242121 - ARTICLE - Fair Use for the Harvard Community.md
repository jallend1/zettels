- Fair use is an exception to the Copyright Act that allows use of opyrighted material without permission
- It is a statutory exemption ingrained into the act itself
- Determining if an instance is Fair Use
	- Purpose
		- Is the goal to make money? Or for non-profit education?
		- Is it transofrmative? Does it add something new or create a new purpose?
	- Nature of the copyrighted work
		- Creative works have more protection than non-fiction ones
		- Inverse relationship to the creativeness of a work and its likely inclusion under Fair Use
	- Amount
		- How much of the work is used?
		- It should be just enough for its purpose
	- Market
		- Is this going to negatively impact the copyright owner?
- Two primary questions courts ask:
	- Does the use transofmr the material by using it for a different purpose?
	- Was the amount taken appropriate to this new purpose?
- Artistic or window-dressing uses are NOT transformative
