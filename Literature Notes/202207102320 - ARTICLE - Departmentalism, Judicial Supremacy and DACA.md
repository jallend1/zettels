# Departmentalism, Judicial Supremacy and DACA
**Source:** https://www.lawfareblog.com/departmentalism-judicial-supremacy-and-daca

- Departmentalism is the idea that each branch of government has the authority to interpret the Constitution in its own sphere
- Reagan, FDR, Jackson, and Lincoln all expressed departmentalist views
- When Abigail Adams was frustrated that Thomas Jefferson pardoned people convicted under the Sedition Act for being nasty to John Adams, he wrote back that it was in the court's jurisdiction to interpret the Constitution in sentencing those individuals, and it was within his jurisdiction to find the law unconstitutional which demanded he pardon them
- Jefferson argued that each branch has equal authority to interpret the Constitution, otherwise the document is meaningless and would be bent to whatever the judiciary wants
- When Obama implemented DACA, he contended that it was a stopgap measure and identified the limitations of his office (a constitutional interpretation), and determined that only Congress had the authority to confer rights of citizenship
- Jeff Sessions, when ending DACA, argued that it was a program that existed outside the Constitutional authority of the presidency, a view consistent with a departmental perspective
