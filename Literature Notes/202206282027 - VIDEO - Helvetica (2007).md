# Helvetica (2007)
  
- Mossimo Vignelli uses few typefaces
- Really generous saying there's a dozen good typefaces -- He generally uses no more than three
- Emerges from Swiss design in 1957
- Helvetica emerged at a type when "rational" typefaces were craved for signage and expressing information about the modern world - clear, communicative, legible
- Part of a broader movement of idealism among designers of the period
	- Neutral font, allowing focus on the content 
- GOvernments very enthusiastic about Helvetica because the smooth letters are simple and clean, as a contrast to the perceptions of government bureaucracy
