- John Joseph Kirby was a DC lawyer who represented Nintendo in their case against Universal over Donkey Kong
- Universal claimed Donkey Kong infringed on their rights to the 1976 remake of King Kong
- Kirby played a key role in winning that fight for Nintendo, and they rewarded him by naming a character after him
- Nintendo also gave him the rights to use Donkey Kong in perpetuity (but only in naming sailboats)
- Kirby also played an important role in laying some of the ground work for the Voting Rights Act of 1965
- Identified predominantly Black regions where the voter registration levels were lower than expected
- Found explanations that included the requirement to translate the meaning of complicated passages from state constitutions
- Kirby left the public sector after disillusionment following the "police riot" at the DNC Convention in 1968
- Joined a commission that wrote a report critical of the Kent State killing, advising that troops should not have live ammunition if engaged in crowd control
- Report met with a bitter response from leaders, including Spiro Agnew
