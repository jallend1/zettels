# The Independent Legislature Theory Explained
- The idea that state legislatures have broad authority to pass voter suppression laws, gerrymander, or overturn election results
- Constitution does delegate election administration to the states, but also grants Congress the power to override it
- The argument hinges on a reading of the word "legislature"
- Adherents to this theory argue tht the legislature can, at any time, make these decisions
- Opponents to the theory argue that they still must be bound by the rules and regulations the legislature itself has set up through earlier imposed constraints, such as state constitutions
- Theory would allow state legislatures essentially absolute authority to overrule elections
- Originates in the Rehnquist opinion in Bush v. Gore
- Some versions of the theory would forbid state legislatures from even delegating any of this authority to governors or secretaries of states
