- Publishers suing the Internet Archive for copyright damages
- They contend IA claims to do controlled digital lending, but has admitted its partner libraries do not actually remove the physical copy from shelves
- Internet Archive temporarily suspended the one book one loan rule during the pandemic after it declared a national emergency
- IA argues that licensed eBooks and scanned copies of physical books are two distinct items
	- Failure to make this distinction means that books could never been owned, only accessed at the rightholder's whims
- IA argues it is not in competition with eBooks, but is instead actually only a program to make the physical books more accessible
- They argue they are not creating eBooks, simply improving accessibility for their already owned materials
- Publishers argue that the IA has failed to pay the customary price for the activities it is undertaking, but IA points out that the customery price a library pays to lend a book it already owns is zero
- Publishers seek to maintain friction in library lending, but copyright law cares nothing about friction.
- Publishers only crave fiction so that patrons will give up and buy their own copies
- IA argues that case law has already firmly established that scanning book sis legal, and that lending books is an important use
