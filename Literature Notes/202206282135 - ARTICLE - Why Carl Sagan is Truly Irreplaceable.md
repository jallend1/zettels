- Sagan marked letters from weirdos with an F/C for "Fissured Ceramics," a fun way of saying "crackpot"
- On grief
	- “I can talk about my father in ordinary conversation without feeling more than the slightest pang of loss. But if I permit myself to remember him closely—his sense of humor, say, or his passionate egalitarianism—the facade crumbles and I want to weep because he is gone. There is no question that language can almost free us of feeling. Perhaps that is one of its functions—to let us consider the world without in the process becoming entirely overwhelmed by feeling. If so, then the invention of language is simultaneously a blessing and a curse.”
- Sagan frequently spoke of how humanity kept getting demoted in importance the more it learned about itself -- The universe doesn't revolve around the Earth, we came about through evolution not some divine plan
	- But after his death, humanity is getting a promotion as it is forced to deal with its impact on its own planet, showing that it is of substantial importance
