# The Constitution Is Whatever the Right Wing Says It Is
**Written By:** Adam Serwer

- Alito's opinion in Dobbs argued that this ruling very narrowly applies only to abortion, and other rights won't be impacted
- Alito also argues that rights not expressly enumerated in the Constitution need to be reeply rooted in America's history to be preserved
- Thomas overtly called for reconsideration of cases expanding rights to contraception and same-sex marriage
- "Undead Constitutionalism" - The conservative belief that the meaning of the Constitution perpetually shifts to find itself to always have been in alignment with whatever the latest rage is on Fox News
	- Decision overturning New York's concealed weapon ban had Clarence Thomas ignoring centuries of gun regulations in order to argue that  gun regulations have no basis in American tradition 
	- SCOTUS blocked, by one vote, requiring social media companies to host content they don't want to, entirely ignoring a century of First Amerndment jurisprudence because the current Right Wing media trend is to be furious at moderation
	- 2006 GOP President extended Voting Rights Act, 2013 GOP justices overruled it based on state's "equal sovereignty," which is not a thing guaranteed by the Constitution
- Purpose of conservative justices is not to apply legal principles, but instead to convert the right wing's current moral panic into law
- Goal of GOP justices is to present their conclusions as perpetual and unwavering, when in reality they are constantly shifting to reflect whatever current REpublican popular opinion is
- The lens the justices are analyzing policy through is that there is a real America, and then there is a liberal one. This lens is the filter that explains all their decisions
