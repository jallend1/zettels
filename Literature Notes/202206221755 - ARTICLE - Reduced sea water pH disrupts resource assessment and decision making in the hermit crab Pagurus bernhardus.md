* Hermit crabs use chemical, visual and tactile assessments in assessing a potential new shell.
* When hermit crabs were exposed to water with a lower pH, which is a consequence of ocean acidification, they demonstrated decreased decision making skills.
* Many crabs failed to move into an objectively better shell than their current one, and even the ones that did make the move, took longer to do so.
* The increased CO2 in the atmosphere is directly impacting the ability of crabs to make decisions.
