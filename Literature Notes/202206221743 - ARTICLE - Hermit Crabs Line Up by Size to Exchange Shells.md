* Hermit crabs have hard little bodies in the front, but delicate little parts in the back.
* Actually more closely related to lobster than they are crabs.
* The shells protect them both from predators, but also from the heat of the sun.
* They demonstrate little concern for aesthetics, but focus on integrity.
* Ocean acidification is having an impact on the quality of available shells, creating weaker and thinner protection for the hermit crabs.
* Since they take up shells they find in nature, they frequently need to upgrade their shell as their bodies get bigger.
* When a hermit crab encounters a shell that's too big for itself, it will hang out there in the hopes that another hermit crab will come along and leave its smaller shell for their taking.
* Multiple crabs can line up in the hope of upgrading their own digs, with everyone moving up one shell size.
