- Environment variables are variables external to application, and are properties of either the OS or the app's container
- Conventionally the name of the keys is capitalized, i.e. PORT=3000
- Using environment variables allows your app to be deployed easily into different environments without code rewrites
- Examples
	- HTTP Port and address
	- Database or other storage information
	- Location of static files
