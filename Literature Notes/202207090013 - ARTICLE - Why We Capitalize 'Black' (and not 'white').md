# # Why we capitalize ‘Black’ (and not ‘white’)
**Source:** https://www.cjr.org/analysis/capital-b-black-styleguide.php

- We capitalize Asian, Hispanic, Native American, African-American 
- The hyphenated African-American feels like it's adding a qualifier to the Americanness of the person
- Also suggests a meaningful relationship with the continent that there is no reason to believe exists
- Slavery intentionally stripped people of their ties to their nation or ethnic identity
