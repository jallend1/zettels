- Material Weight Illusion
	- When a person holds two items of identical weight, that person will feel like the one that looks lighter is actually the heavier of the two
	- The life experience we had leading up to this moment has made it a contradiction, resulting in our brain rejecting what our body is telling us and drawing the conclusion that this item is uniquely heavy
- 2019 study suggests that might not be true
	- When people were presented with blocks comprised of two halves of differing materials (styrofoam and wood, stone and wood, etc..), people regularly picked the material that looked heavier
	- Their hypothesis is that context alters the way our brains calculate weight, and rather than our brain rejecting the body's assessment, it's contextualizing the information and assuming that the heavier looking thing is still heavier, just not as heavy as we expected
