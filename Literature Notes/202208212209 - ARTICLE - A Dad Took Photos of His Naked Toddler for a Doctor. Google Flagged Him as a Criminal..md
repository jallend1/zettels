- Father took a picture of his kid's inflamed junk to send to a doctor
- Google's AI flagged it as harmful, and blocked his account and denied all appeals
- Because he was a Google Fi subscriber, not only lost a decade plus of photos, emails, and contacts, he also had to change his telephone number
- In addition to blocking him, reported him to police
- Police investigated him and cleared him, but Google still refused to reinstate his account
- Google created an AI service that it shares with Facebook to locate material that exploits children
- Apple planned to roll out a similar service, but delayed after outcry from privacy advocates
