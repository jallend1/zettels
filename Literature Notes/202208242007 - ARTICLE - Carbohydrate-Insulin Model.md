- Commonly held belief is that obesity is a result of overconsuming energy-dense food
- But shift in national focus to calorie reduction and increased activity has made no dent
- Carboyhdrate-Insulin Model (CIM): Rapidly digestible carbs cause a chemical response that drives fat storage
- Energy-Balance Model (EBM) - Tasty and energy-dense modern processed foods result in a positive energy balance 
	- EBM considers all calories as metabolically equivalent
- Little evidence connects highly palatable foods to increased weight gain
	- Rats gain weight when given "junk" food over their regular food
	- But when added tasty flavors to their food, rats loved the flavored over the non-flavored one, but failed to increase either the amount of food they consumed or their weight
- CIM posits that glycemic load is the primary driver of energy imbalances
	- High GL foods include processed grains, potato products
	- Low GL foods include whole fruits, legumes, nonstarchy vegetables
	- Fats and proteins have no direct impact
