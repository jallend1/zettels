Weingarten Rights are the federally protected rights of a union represented employee to ask for and have a union representative present at any meeting where they have a reasonable expectation that the meeting might lead to discipline.

Before an investigatory meeting:
1. Find out the topic of investigation (High level is fine, i.e. "Attendance"). This knowledge is part of Weingarten Rights.
2. Meet with the employee to get their side. (This is about attendance, what can you tell me about that)
3. Give member advice:
	1. Keep it short and sweet
	2. Don't lie.
	3. Only answer questions asked.
	4. It's okay to say you don't remember
	5. Explain your role

During an investigatory meeting, the role of the steward is to:
1. Advise the employee to answer turthfully
2. Ask clarifying questions
3. Keep management on track (e.g. "You've already asked that question. Is there another one we could answer for you?")
4. Do NOT argue the case or answer questions for the member.
5. Call for a break if necessary(e.g. If you know they lie, take a break to advise them that they are engaging in risky behavior)
6. Request copies of any documentation referred to
7. "Comply now, grieve later"

After an investigatory meeting
1. Debrief
2. Provide additional information or corroboration if found
3. Follows up with management for results based on timeline provided
