Examine Policies

-- They can be changed

-- Do they uphold the status quo

-- What is the fear if we extend privileges to a group

-- i.e. Expanded access to paid resources to undergrads that had no meaningful impact on budget // Privileging staff over patrons? // Excluding Seattle patrons??

Learn and Act at the same time 

-- Don't wait for permission or for other people to act first -- Create momentum by starting action
