## Notes

-   European approach too broad to have any meaning  
	-   Netherlands exclusively private insurance
	-   France blend of government / private   
	-   Sweden exclusively government
-   80/20 rule of healthcare
-   20% of the populous consistently responsible for 80% of the costs
-   FDR felt local opposition to healthcare would have jeopardized New Deal more broadly
	-   Exempted emerging health plans from private employers like Baylor from wartime wage limits, allowing healthcare to become an employment incentive
	-   Labor unions successfully bargained for the right to negotiate healthcare, giving them an interest in the perpetuation of the system
-   Truman’s Obstacles
	- Thwarted by fear of Southern Democrats that it might end segregated hospitals
    - Emerging Cold War made America tepid on socialism
    - Popular support not enough to overcome
-   Community rates (one charge for all people) helped hide problematic future of private insurance companies
	-   Lower cost to draw customers away from Blue Cross
	-   Private insurance charged more for people working in mines, history of cancer, etc…
	-   Those people fled to higher priced Blue Cross, forcing them to raise rates further as they were left only with the sick
-   Labor unions pushed against signing Nixon’s expansion of healthcare because they thought they’d get a better deal after impeachment
-   People are guaranteed the right to a lawyer when they’re accused of a crime, and should be guaranteed the right to a doctor when they’re sick
