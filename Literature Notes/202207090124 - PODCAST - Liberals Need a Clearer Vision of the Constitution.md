## Notes

Liberals adopt the concept of judicial supremacy around the time of the Warren Court

If the founding fathers had been originalists, we wouldn't be here because they interpreted it differently almost immediately

The idea that Courts have final say over the Constitution is a concept  developed in the 20th Century that began with Brown v. Board of Education

Marbury v. Madison is not cited ever for anything about Judicial Review until the late 20th Century 

Marbury was a rejection of judicial supremacy

Judicial Supremacy is the concept that once the courts say something, all other branches are supposed to get on board

The court was seen as looking at laws to see if they were constitutional in an effort to determine whether or not they could apply them in their rulings - If the law was unconstitutional, they can't apply it to their ruling in their case -- 

Departmentalism - Each department has its own authority to interpret the Constitution - (Marbury's argument)

During divided government, the court has room to run because there is no consolidation of opposition

  

No engagement with the right to abortion by the dissenting justices, instead made an appeal that it's wrong to repeal Roe v Wade and Casey - Respect for precedent versus pushing an alternate view

  

Skinner - You can't sterilize someone affter three crimes because there is a fundamental right to have children

Griswold - Birth control is okay becaus eyou have a fundamental right to not have kids

  

FDR's court packing is good, actually! FDR elected with a huge majority to fix a broken system, and court invoked outdated interpretive legal theories to nullify the first new deal

Not just FDR, but many contemporaries at the time argued that this is not how a functioning democracy operates

Wasn't popular at the time, but not an isolated act and instead part of a broader campaign to draw attention to the way the Court operates -- Court adjusts course and approves second new deal

FDR abandoned it as it was no longer needed because the Court adjusted

Constitution as a layman's docukent not a lawyers contract -- fdr    

  

  

  

Hamilton is a good person with harmful ideas, Jefferson is a bad person with good ideas

  

Court has regularly asserted its authority where it is crushed

late 1810s

Early Jackson era around Second Bank

1850s in Dred Scott 

1880s and 90s - Lockner fight??

Comes to head in New Deal where it gets crushed

Reasserts itself in the 50s - First time in history there is a liberal court that is seeking to reassert its authority - Older liberals are skeptical, but newer liberals flip on the issue of judicial supremacy -- Conservatives stay the same, so the argument becomes not over who has final say to HOW the constitution should be interpreted (origins of Originalism emerging in the 70s)

  

  

If the court was intended to function this way with the capability of essentially making vast law, the system would have been designed differently to allow some kind of check. Easier to make amendments like in other countries, etc....

  

Congress shrunk Court after Lincoln's assassination because they dont' want to give hima ppointments

​Modern liberal court opinions are holding onto decisions from a time when liberals had a broad vision for what the constitution says - Not advocating a vision, but instead only defending decisions arising from earlier visions

  

Heller case argues that right to own guns is critical in preventing tyranny, but only applies to handguns and the type of weaponryone would actually need to fight the government 

  

Fdr economic royalists 1934 hide behind the flag constitution 

  ""The economic royalists complain that we seek to overthrow the institutions of America. What they really complain of is that we seek to take away their power. Our allegiance to American institutions requires the overthrow of this kind of power."

Dobbs opinion regularly highlighted activism of Warren court in justifying their decisions 

  

Arguing that the Founding is about just one thing is bonkers. Strain of Repluicanism was ever present pushing against anyo democratic nature of constitution 

  

Jeffersonian vision expected active engagement fr voters, not just election day action and then fade into woodwork

  

Ptedistrbution - economy can be laid out in a way where equity if outcomes is baked in more, rather than government taking back prifits

  

Appoint scotis every two years, most recent 9 justices decide cases - closer to people

Eliminates garland blockage or Barrett billdoze

  

No instance of court adopting right majority of Americans oppose?

  

Anti-Oligrachy Constitution

The Second Creation - Jenepp?? Originalism

When We Cease to Understand the World
