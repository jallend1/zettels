- LB&SC E2 replaced the E1s as they aged into needing replacements
- E2 good at shunting around coaches and trailers, but had small water tanks needing frequent refills
- Second batch had larger water tanks, but had limited fuel capacity requiring frequent filling up
- Unsuitable for passenger train because the engine oscillation caused an uncomfortable ride and the small fuel capacity
- Shifted to docks loading and unloading ships, though their wheel base limited them to only certain portions of the yard because they were unable to make certain turns
- Designed for hauling freight, but never suited for that role
- Air brakes engaged too sharp, and the engine brakes were poor
- All scrapped
