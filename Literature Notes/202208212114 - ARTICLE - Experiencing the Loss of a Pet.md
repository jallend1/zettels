- Pets are as important to us as human relationships
	- Surveys have respondents indicating that their relationship to their pets is of social heiarachy on par with partners, family and friends
	- Studies also have found that people rank their relationship to their pets as higher than that of their siblings, but lower than parents and romantic partners
- Disenfranchised Grief
	- The sense of illegitimacy that surrounds the loss of a pet, and the feeling that you should qualify it as somehow less than the loss of a person
	- A grief that feels as if it cannot be declared openly or receives a lack of support among one's peers
