- 58% of Americans now believe Trump should be charged with a 1/6 related crime
- Many formalities between election day and inauguration we all treated simply as formalities -- Trump and allies did something new by contesting those potential breakpoints
- Politics aren't rules on a piece of paper you follow, but often simple agreements
- Violating those agreements, without any punishment, forever alter that agreement and shift what's possible
- Process since 1789 has essentially been an American effort to shoehorn in democratic principles into the Constitution
- Democratization begins almost immediately
- Universal white male suffrage by Andrew Jackson's time
- Logic of revolution pointed towards democratization while the Constitution fought against it
- Big distinction between Republic and Democracy is their origin, with Republic having Roman origins versus Democracy having Greek - Larglely the only distinction, especially at the time of the founding
- Modern usage seems to just mean "only some people get to decide" (REAL PATRIOTS)
- Does that mean electors should have chosen Clinton, and Trumpers would be fine?
- Americans and American media seem to treat the existence of secrecy as evidence of juiciness and cover it accordingly - Why many of Trump;s scandals didn't resonate because he boasted about it
