-   Section 108 - “Notwithstanding the exclusive rights of the owners of copyright…it is not an infringement for libraries to copy or distribute..”
-   Very little case law on this!
-   A test and three buckets
	-   Library Test - Qualified to use Section 108    
	-   Save It!
		-   Perservation / Copy
		-   Copies of Unpublished Works
			-   Copy is exclusively for preservation or security purposes
			-   Currently in collection of the library making the copy
			-   If one copy is digital, copy is allowed, but not allowed to used outside the premises of the library
		-   Published Works
			-   The work is damaged, lost or in a format that is obsolete
				-   Obsolete Format: Machine or device necessary to render it perceptible is no longer manufactured or is no longer reasonably commercial available
				-   Betamax or VHS players available on secondary markets like eBay?
			-   An unused replacement copy cannot be obtained at a fair price
			-   Digital formats allowed for preservation, but digital copy limited to the premises of the library
	-   Scholar’s Delight / Document Delivery
		-   An article or short excerpt from a copyrighted works IF
			-   Must become the property of the user, and you do not keep a copy
			-   The purpose is for private study, research, or scholarship
			-   Library must display copyright warning notice
		-   An entire out of print work may be copied if:
			-   A copy cannot be obtained at a fair price
			-   Copy becomes property of the user
			-   Purpose of the copy is for private study, research, or scholarship
			-   Library prominently displays copyright warning
			-   Does not apply to audiovisual
			-   108(h)
			-   Libraries may copy or digitize works that are in the last 20 years of their copyright term
			-   Sonny Bono Memorial Collection - Full rendering of works still in copyright, but the last 20 years of that copyright
			-   Test - Libraries should make a reasonable effort to determine that:
				-   Work is not subject to normal commercial exploitation (Strange language! Maybe…still for sale??)
				-   Copy cannot be obtained at a reasonable price
				-   Copyright holder has not filed notice with Register of Copyrights that either of the above apply (Not one published has yet filed one of these notices in the history of the act)
	-   Get out of Jail Free
		-   Reproducing Equipment
		-   Libraries are not responsible for copyright violations IF a copyright notice is posted
		-   Copyright notice required…Fair use isn’t, but seems a nice addition!
			-   Legislative History
				-   Report of the Register of Copyrights recommended separate provision in 1961 over libraries because they were worried that eras enormous and ponderous Xerox machines would render publishing extinct
	-   The Test
		-   Museums not included in this test!
		-   A library or archive must comply with three requirements
			-   Any copying must not be done for direct or indirect commercial advantage
			-   Library must be open to the public or outside researchers
			-   Each copy made must include a notice of copyright
	    -   Conflicting opinions about whether this applies to for-profit libraries
	-   Interlibrary Loan and Section 108(g)
		-   Balancing interests between publishers and libraries 
		-   Shuffled clay tablets in antiquity between libraries
		-   1917 ALA Code for ILL:
			-   Aid research to advance the boundaries of knowledge by loan of unusual books not accessible everywhere
			-   Augment supply of the average book for the average reader
		-   Section 108(g) Proviso slipped in to allow for ILL agreements so long as it doesn’t mean they don’t buy the a subscription or the work
		-   CONTU (Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works) established guidelines about what amount of copying and lending would constitute a substitution of buying the work
			-   Georgetown, Ohio State, among libraries that decided to ignore CONTU
			-   Comission established under the assumption that guidelines would not be firm and would be regularly revaluated
			-   Based on 1970s prices (ignoring explosion of journal prices, defunding of libraries)
			-   Copyright Clearing House (CCC) funder of several lawsuits against libraries
    -   Potential new workflow in slides???
		-   Meg wrote the paper?? I can’t find it :(
