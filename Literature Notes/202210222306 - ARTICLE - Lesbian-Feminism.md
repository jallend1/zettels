- Lesbian as a political-identity gaines strength with Second Wave Feminism, where politics was the defining characteristic instead of sexual preference
- Independence from male oppression was the core belief of lesbian-feminists, seeking to separate themselves physically and economically from men
- Popular definition of lesbian among lesbian-feminists Daughters of Bilitis was "a woman whose primary erotic, psychological, emotional and social interest is in a member of her own sex, even though that interest may not be overtly expressed"
- Lesbian-feminism was a movement pioneered and dominated by youth, and got little leeway among older lesbians
- Other lesbians who had an essentialist view that they were born gay or that lesbian required same-sex sexual attraction found the lesbian-feminist approach to be detrimental to the cause of gay rights
- Lesbian-feminists often refused to collaborate with gay men due to a perception of chauvinism
