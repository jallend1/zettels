# Digital Minimalism - Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World
**By:** Cal Newport

- Ceding more and more of my autonomy
- Accelerates shift towards emotional charged and draining language - Unavoidable feature of the medium
- Reflexive and all consuming
1) Clutter is costly - Too many devices and services negates the benefits that each item provides in isolation
	* One of Thoreau's purposes in Walden was to craft an economic theory centering around the idea that more can be less
	* The cost of a thing is the amount of time exchanged for it
2) Optimization is important - Carefully consider HOW the technology will be used in their life
3) Intentionality is satisfying
	-   My brain feels constantly interrupted by other people's minds. Turn off podcast when I get into Safeway, and it's immediately replaced with the Katy Perry song playing overhead. Feels like there is very little solitude in my life, which is a condition I have imposed on myself.
-   Writing sometimes forces a certain cohesion that helps me work through things
-   Blog as a way to externalize my thoughts because I think my brain convinces me that I understand something, but when I try to explain it to someone else, all sorts of blindspots emerge.
