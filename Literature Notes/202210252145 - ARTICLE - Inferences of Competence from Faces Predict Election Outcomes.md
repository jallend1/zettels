**Sources:** Inferences of Competence from Faces Predict Election Outcomes by Alexander Todorv, Anesu Mandisodza

- Based only on showing faces to people, researchers were able to predict outcomes of US congressional elections at nearly a 70% accuracy rate in 2004
- Respondents had no context for the faces in question -- If they were recognized, they were discarded
- Competence is one of the most important traits voters look for in politicians
- Respondents were showed black and white photos of congressional winners and their runner up from 2000, 2002 and 2004 elections
- The candidate perceived as most competent won 71% of the Senate races and 66.8% of the House races
- Additionally, exposing respondents to the pair of faces for only 1 second returned a 67.6% accuracy rating for Senate races
- Competence was the only one correlated to election outcomes, whereas likeability and trust weren't reliable predictors
- Additional information about the candidates can dilute the effect
- Dilution does seem to be minimal and actual prefences seemed based on the initial assessment of competence
- Concerning implications for democracy, and suggests that even the most consequential elections are a lot more superficial than one might hope
- Darwin noted that he was almost not allowed to embark on the Beagle because the captain of the ship didn't believe that someone with a nose like his would have the constitution to make such a journey
