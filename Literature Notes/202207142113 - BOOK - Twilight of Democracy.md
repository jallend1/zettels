Twilight of Democracy: The Seductive Lure of Authoritarianism

By Anne Applebaum

-   Poland (now reversed under American pressure) adopted a law forbidding public debate about the Holocaust  
-   Law & Justice party sought new targets after initial Muslim attacks did little due to lack of Muslims in Poland
-   Polish municipalities have implemented LGBT free zones, supported by a national magazine that include stickers for readers to put on their houses
-   State TV ran a documentary about the secret LGBT agenda undermining Poland’s sovereignty
-   Archbishop of Krakow, formerly home to Pope John Paul II, referred to LGBT people as a “Rainbow colored plague”
-   Given the right condition, any society can devolve from democracy. With history as an indicator, it may be inevitable
-   Hannah Arendt focused on loneliness and isolation from belonging as a leading source of totalitarian tendencies
-   Karen Stenner (Behavior Economist) argues about ⅓ of any nation’s population as an authoritarian predisposition (favoring homogeneity and order)

-   Libertarian predisposition is the antithesis of the authoritarianism (favoring diversity and difference)
    
-   Not a political philosophy definition, but one that describes their intolerance for nuance and complexity
    

Chapter 2 - How Demagogues Win

-   Illiberal one-party state first developed by Lenin in Russia in 1917
    

-   Not a philosophy, but only a mechanism for holding power
    
-   Cross-compatibility with many diverse ideologies
    
-   Jobs under this system go to the most loyal, not efficient 
    

-   A rigged system sounds bad if you want to live in a society that is guided by the talented, but if talent isn’t your focus and instead prioritize other things like loyalty to the party or to a particular value, not a response untethered from reality
    

-   Why should different parties have an even playing field if only one should be allowed to rule?
    

-   Demagogues focus on talking about emotive issues (foreign invasion, etc..) that allow people to paper over the corruption and graft  of their administration
    
-   Poland and Hungaryon the slide toward authoritarianism
    

Chapter 3- The Future of Nostalgia

-   Unity is an anomaly; Polarization is normal
    
-   “We are Greeks to their Romans” -- British description of their relationship with the US
    
-   Nostalgics
    

-   Reflective - Love the idea of the past, but recognize they likely wouldn’t find happiness in a return to it
    
-   Restorative Nostalgics - 
    

-   Ones who build monuments and seek to actually return 
    
-   Founders of nationalist parties
    
-   Reject a nuanced past with drawbacks -- adopting a cartoon version of history that they want to live in right now
    
-   Often goes hand-in-hand with conspiracy theories
    

Chapter 4 - Cascades of Falsehood

-   Karen Stenner - Researcher on Authoritarian Predispositions
    

-   Authoritiarian predisposition better described as simple mindedness instead of closed mindedness
    
-   People draw to these ideas due to an aversion to complexity and a preference for unity
    
-   Sudden onslaughts of diversity (opinions, etc) cause anger
    
-   Arrival of immigrants, economic change often instigators of these panics
    

-   Immigrant backlash is often independent of assimilation - German backlash to Jews came not when they arrived, but when they integrated themselves into society and enjoyed success
    
-   The way that information is presented to us in the modern day may be driving a turn towards authoritarianism, where all those frustrated by diversity of opinions are on overload
    
-   A strong preference of for a single national narrative has a tension with the noise of disagreement
    
-   Isiah Berlin said humans have a desire to believe there is a final solution
    
-   The idea that all of our values aren’t compatible with one another (freedom vs. efficiency) forces the realization that complete fulfillment is unobtainable
    
-   Most political disagreements in Western democracies have taken place on a very narrow spectrum between center left and center right parties
    

-   Some factors have historically bound these groups around common ideals
    

-   The Cold War in the US
    
-   A dedication to the EU in Europe
    
-   Dominance of broadcast television
    
-   Desire to appeal broadly confined the arguments because they wanted viewership and advertising dollars
    

-   Printing press
    

-   Positives include the ending of the dominance of the Catholic Church over the spiritual, mass literacy, growth of knowledge
    
-   Negatives created new divisions inspiring the Protestant reformation and centuries of bloody wars
    

-   Radio
    

-   Hitler and Stalin early adopters of the strength of the new medium
    

-   Collapse of newspapers have allowed for previously filtered out conspiracy theories to become mainstream
    

-   Everybody now has their own set of facts
    

-   ​Nigel Garage's UKIP as an allegory for Trump?
    

-   Initially condemned but as popularity rose, increasingly embraced by the Stories
    
-   Leave campaign ran targeted xenophobic ads to animal rights activists showing Spanish bullfighting, tea enthusiast shown hand reaching towards British cup tagged with EU as of the EU is going to take away British tea
    
-   Leave campaign supported by Russian hackers that mostly amplified Leave campaigns already nasty messaging
    

-   If Brexit was the only thing capable of bringing about desired change to British institutions, no level of illegal activity supporting it would be too much
    
-   Tory MEPs defended Poland's court packing because they caucused together. Also protected Orban from censure for undermining Hungary's judiciary because they wanted to protect sovereign rights to defy EU
    
-   Britain was formerly the most important connection between the US and the EU
