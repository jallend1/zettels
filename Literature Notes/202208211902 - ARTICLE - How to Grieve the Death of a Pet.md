- Pets provide unconditional love and support, and the loss of that support can have dramatic impacts on people
- Euthanasia complicates things by adding a potential for guilt on top of everything else
- Losing a pet can be more difficult than losing a human
- How to grieve
	- Realize your grief is valid
		- Losing a pet is an important moment in a person's life, and the feelings of loss shouldn't be diminished because it is "just" a pet 
	- Recognize grief is different for everyone
		- The phases of grief aren't linear, and aren't one-direction. Bouncing between the different phases is normal and expected
	- Create Physical Memorials
		- Physical representations of your loss allow expression of your grief
	- Join a Support Group
		- Find comfort in others who have experienced similar loss
	- Make Sure Your Entire Family is Supported
		- Your pets will also feel this loss and manifest it in different ways
- You don't ever move on, you move forward
- Kubler-Ross Model of Grief
	- Denial
	- Anger
