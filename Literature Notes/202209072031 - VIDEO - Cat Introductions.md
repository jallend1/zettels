1. Introduce by scent
2. Only then introduce visually

Base camp: Smaller part of the house to get familiar with their surroundings
Site swapping: Frequently switch areas of the house where 

Step 1: Use a door to separate cats for introduction
 -- Set up a base camp: Smaller part of the house to get familiar with their new surroundings

Step 2: Site swapping
 -- Frequently switch areas of the house where you are keeping your cats separated
 -- Don't let anyone get static in one location and foster a false sense of ownership

No free-feeding! Feed at meal times. Together.

3 feet from bowl to door. Gradually move up. Reset when graduating from closed door to gate.

Foster positive association - When cats smell each other, they are smelling food. If hissing, growling, etc...Move bowls back.

Graduate from closed door to gate - Drape towel over gate, allowing a small visual connection with eyes on one another.

Eat, play, love - Put them in the same room entirely supervised. But constantly playing with them, feeding them, etc...Just trying to make them ignore the other cat. Even if it's just 15 seconds. Try to end on a high note.

1.  Existing cat needs to be on a meal. No free-feeding.
    
2.  Set up a base camp for the new cat - No eye contact!

1.  Don’t let them stay there non-stop
    
2.  Site-swap!
    

4.  Catification
    

1.  One extra litter box
    
2.  Allow for escape routes with litter boxes and for general meeting - Cats will look for vertical space when spooked
    

  

Introduction

-   Step 1: Other side of the door feeding ritual
    

-   Any time they smell food, they smell each other and any time they smell each other, they smell food. Good vibes
    
-   Gradually move the bowls closer to the door over time. 
    

-   No hissing, no growling. 
    
-   Three feet on each side is usually a good spot
    
-   Gradually reduce the challenge line with each feeding
    

-   Step 2: Visual Access
    

-   Once the bowls are door to door, switch to gate
    
-   Drape a towel over the gate and gradually and slowly raise it while moving the bowls closer
    

-   Step 3: Eat, play, love
    

-   Put them in the same room
    
-   Don’t leave them bored
    
-   Keep them constantly engaged with toys each playing separately
    
-   It avoids the staredown
    

-   If the staredown happens, separate them and do it again tomorrow
    

-   Step 4: Have realistic expectations
    

-   Having the cats tolerate each other is the promised land

Video # 4 - Good First Impressions are a Must

-   Challenge Line
-   When faced with something challenging, we shrink back. 
-   The line separating comfort from challenge
-   A new space is all challenge, no comfort
-   Opening up entire house will be very challenging 
-   Site-swapping
-   Resident cat needs to know what base camp is like, new guy needs to know about the rest
-   Let them explore
-   Do it in a positive way - Give them treats  while they’re doing it
-   Play with their favorite toys in the new space
-   As soon as cat starts experiencing fear or aggression, call it a day -- 10 seconds or 10 minutes
