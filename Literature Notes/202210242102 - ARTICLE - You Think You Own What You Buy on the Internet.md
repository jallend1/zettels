- Not owning digital items means we are subjected to whatever corprorate whim occurs to them in perpetuity and potential victims of their failure
- We don't own digital media the same way we do with physical copies of CDs and DVDs
- The 'Buy Now' button on sites like Amazon or iTunes leaves the distinct impression that you are, in fact, buying it
	- COmpanies are relying on you not reading the 4-page leasing agreement that accompanies your $0.99 purchase of a song
- Lawyers and these companies are abundantly clear that we are only leasing these items, and media is now being treated the same way software has been since the 90s, where nobody owns any of it
- If when you signed a lease for a car and it was listed as 'Buy Now,'' the FTC would take action for false and deceptive advertising
- Media companies could simply rename the button to "Lease" or "rent" instead, or provide an actual buying option -- They simply like the confusion
