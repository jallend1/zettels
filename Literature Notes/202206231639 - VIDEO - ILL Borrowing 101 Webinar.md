-   Download Interlibrary Loan Code for the United States
-   IFLA - International Federation of Library Associations - Principles and Guidelines 
-   Explain policies clearly, defining what ILL is and what it is not
	-   Who is eligible? (Reciprocal??)
	-   What will we borrow?
	-   Limits? What's their purpose?
-   Automate, automate, automate
	-   Custom holdings, routing rules, etc...

-   IFLA Vouchers??
-   Returnables
	-   Items can be recalled at any time
	-   Restrictions imposed by lender apply (Library use only, no photocopying, no renewals, etc...)
	-   Adhesive material (tape, labels) should not be put on borrowed items
	-   Item is due back **at your library** on the due date -- Update to ILL code

-   Responsibility for borrowed materials
	-   Borrower responsible for materials from the time they leave the lender, to the time they are received back at lender
	-   Would be safe and sound on the library shelf w/o the request

-   eBook lending is limited at this point

-   If licensing permits ILL loan privileges, go for it!
-   Virginia's VIVA Consortium **Whole Ebook lending** project negotiated better licensing
-   Licensing permissions does not mean the infrastructure to do so exists

-   Purchasing alternatives to ILL
	-   Automatically treat ILL requests as purchase requests as a way to ensure collection reflects community
	-   Online bookstores may sell copies (new or used) that could be cheaper than borrowing
	-   Give to patron? Add to collection? Resell? 
	-   ie what happens to our weeded materials?
	-   Purchase access to a document
	-   Document supplies like British Library
	-   Open Access (OA) - LINK IN POWERPOINT

-   Consider alternate workflows
	-   Search Google before OCLC? 
	-   Count as filled request?
	-   Link or file to user?

-   Some library using InstantILL for seamless delivery to users
-   Controlled Digital Lending for ILL (Link in PowerPoint)
	-   An entire book is scanned, and lent out to a patron
	-   The physical book removed the shelves during that time while the digital surrogate is out
	-   Once the digital copy returned, print one placed back out on shelf

-   International ILL Toolkit
-   sILLver streaming movie lending
-   Clarity about licensing agreement for chapter requests from eBooks
