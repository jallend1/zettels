- Canceling is the manifestation of agency, a cognitive choice to withdraw your attention because someone's values or speech is so offensive that one no longer wishes to grace them with your presence, time or money.
- The public sphere has an inherent assumption that public discourse is the realm of the elites
- Being canceled has shifted into a moral panic where actual harm is perceived, leading to pearl clutching about censorship and silencing
- "Cancel Culture" should most frequenntly be interpreted as an appeal for justice
- The swiftness that resistance has emerged to the concept of cancel culture crystalizes who is actually in charge of what is called the public sphere
- Those framing pushback against unpopular opinions from celebrities and politicians as a violation are primarily trying to quash any effort at losing their social position in establishing the discourse
- Social media has reduced barriers between the elites and normal people, and the elites are less able to avert their eyes
