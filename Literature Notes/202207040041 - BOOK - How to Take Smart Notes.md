# How to Take Smart Notes

Chapter 1

-   Wrestling with your sentence is the result of trying to find the right expression
-   Bad thinking often fails to sort through disconfirming facts
-   Notes without context prove useless
-   Correlating them with other notes allows structure and compounding interest
-   Success results from smart working environments that circumvent resistance, as opposed to willpower
-   Slipbox Functionality
-   Lumen had two slipboxes
-   1) Bibliographic references - References and brief notes about the content of the literature
	-   Bibliographic info on one side
	- Brief notes about the content on the other side
-   2) Main One - Collected and generated ideas written
-   Review bibliographic reference, write ideas comments and thoughts on new pieces of paper
-   One per idea and one side of the paper
-   Assigned fixed numbers, and assigned that number based on relevance
-   New note relevant to card 23, so assigns it 24
-   If 24 exists, assigned in 23a, etc…
-   If you want to learn something long term, you have to write it down. If you want to understand something, you have to translate it into your own words
-   Externalization of knowledge is critical

-   Step #1 
	-   Take fleeting notes
	-   Anything you find interesting, note! You can discard later

-   Step #2
	-   Make literature notes
	-   Make notes about the content of whatever you read
	-   Write down what you don’t wanna forget or might use in your own thinking
	-   Keep it short
	-   Be selective
	-   Use your own words
	-   Extra-selective with quotes - Don’t copy them to skip the important step of understanding what they really mean
	-   Keep these notes with the bibliographic record
    

-   Step #3
	-   Make Permanent Notes
	-   Go through the notes from step one and two regularly (ideally once a day before you forget what you mean) and think about how they relate to each other and your interests
	-   The slipbox itself becomes a good reference for what’s important to your interests over time
	-   Write exactly one note per idea
	-   Write as if you are writing for someone else    
	-   Use full sentences, disclose sources, make references
	-   Be precise and brief as popular
	-   Discard fleeting notes and file literature notes

-   Step # 4
	-   Add Permanent Notes to Slipbox by filing them to related notes
	-   Add links to related notes
	-   Link to it from index or from an entry point

-   Step # 5
	-   Develop projects and ideas from the bottom up
	-   Read more based on what is prevalent from your notes or one that offers insight
	-   Flow with your ideas and change to new topics easily
-   Step # 6
	-   When ready to move forward on a paper or a project, pull all your relevant notes
	-   Structure them in a meaningful way
	-   Identify gaps and weaknesses
-   Step # 7 
	-   Turn notes into a rough draft
	-   Build your argument out of those notes
-   Step # 8
	- -   Edit and proofread and celebrate

The Four Fundamental Principles

Section 5

-   WRITING IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS
-   Writing is a manifestation of preceded performance (learning, understanding and analyzing
-   Studying done properly is about gaining insight when it is not anticipated
-   Learning where the story goes, not finding evidence to confirm what you think
-   Treating writing as the only thing that matters changes your approach to everything else
-   Forces you to elaborate on it and understand it thoroughly
-   Which context would I like to stumble this information again?

Section 6

-   Simplicity is paramount
-   Note taking often focuses on methods that make immediate sense
	-   i.e. See something interesting, underline it and move on
	-   Easy in the moment, but ignores the actual goal - LEARNING
-   Purposes
	-   Fleeting Notes
		-   Capturing ideas quickly when you’re doing something else
	-   Permanent Notes
		-   Written in a way that are understood even when removed from the econtext
	-   Project Notes
		-   Notes that can be discarded after completion of a particular task

Section 9

-   Multi-tasking is NOT focusing on doing multiple things at once -- It’s shifting focus between multiple things repeatedly    
-   Mere Exposure Effect - Doing something many times makes us believe we have become good at it, entirely independent of results; Conflates familiarity with skill

Section 10 - Read for Understanding

-   Read with a pen in hand
-   Purpose is not to copy, but to have a conversation with the subject matter
-   Studies suggest hand-writing notes increases understanding over typing
-   Typing is more representative of the original material, but student comprehension of the material was significantly lower
-   The inability of someone handwriting notes to write down every word forced internalized summarization of ideas
-   Keep an open mind
-   A good workflow forces you to work more virtuously by sidestepping opportunities for failure (i.e. Odysseus tying himself to his ship so he can hear the Siren song)
-   Indiscriminate recording of a diverse array of information helps counteract accidental confirmation bias
-   Instead of having a focus on our preconceived ideas we want to:
-   Isolate our support of a certain way of thinking from the task at hand, which is understanding the text before us
-   Accurately represent its content
-   Connect that content with relevant ideas
-   Most important aspect of the slipbox is that everything connects or is open to a connection
-   If learning is the purpose, cramming is an act of chaos
-   Working with a slip box isn’t just external storage -- it encourages analysis, multiple exposure to facts, and a deep consideration of how these facts are connected

Section 11 -- Take Smart Notes
-   Measure productivity by number of notes per day?
-   Main guy averaged 6 a day 
-   The written form provides a little bit of distance to allow our brain to recognize inconsistencies in our thought process
    
### Adding Permanent note to slipbox
-   Step 1
	-   Add new note directly behind a relevant note that you refer to, or to the end
	-   Number it consecutively
-   Step 2
	- Add links to other notes or links from other notes to your new note
-   Step 3
	-   Make sure it can be found from index
	- Add to index directly, or to a note that can be found from index
-   Step 4
	-   Build a lattice work of general ideas

Section 12 - Develop Ideas
-   What instance do I want to stumble on this note versus where should this be stored
