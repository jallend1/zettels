# Clean Code

- There will always be code. Code is the details of the request, and specifying those requirements in a way that the machine will interpret the way we want will always be a thing that exists
- Well specified requirements are as formal as code
- Code is simply the language we use to express our requirements
- Leblanc's Law : Later = Never
- Clean Code: Straightforward logic making it hard for bugs to hide; Minimal dependencies to ease maintenance
- Clean code does one thing well
- Bad code tries to do too much; Has ambiguity of purpose
- Clean code solves one problem, disregarding all events outside of itrs scope
- Clean code should "read like well-written prose"
